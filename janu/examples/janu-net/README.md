# Janu-net Rust examples

## Start instructions

   When janu is built in release mode:
   ```bash
   ./target/release/example/<example_name>
   ```

   Each example accepts the `-h` or `--help` option that provides a description of its arguments and their default values.

   If you run the tests against the janu router running in a Docker container, you need to add the
   `-e tcp/localhost:7447` option to your examples. That's because Docker doesn't support UDP multicast
   transport, and therefore the janu scouting and discrovery mechanism cannot work with.

## Examples description

### zn_scout

   Scouts for janu peers and routers available on the network.

   Typical usage:
   ```bash
      zn_scout
   ```

### zn_info

   Gets information about the janu-net session.

   Typical usage:
   ```bash
      zn_info
   ```


### zn_write

   Writes a path/value into Janu.  
   The path/value will be received by all matching subscribers, for instance the [zn_sub](#zn_sub)
   and [zn_storage](#zn_storage) examples.

   Typical usage:
   ```bash
      zn_write
   ```
   or
   ```bash
      zn_write -p /demo/example/test -v 'Hello World'
   ```

### zn_pub

   Declares a resource with a path and a publisher on this resource. Then writes a value using the numerical resource id.
   The path/value will be received by all matching subscribers, for instance the [zn_sub](#zn_sub)
   and [zn_storage](#zn_storage) examples.

   Typical usage:
   ```bash
      zn_pub
   ```
   or
   ```bash
      zn_pub -p /demo/example/test -v 'Hello World'
   ```

### zn_sub

   Registers a subscriber with a selector.  
   The subscriber will be notified of each write made on any path matching the selector,
   and will print this notification.

   Typical usage:
   ```bash
      zn_sub
   ```
   or
   ```bash
      zn_sub -s /demo/**
   ```

### zn_pull

   Registers a pull subscriber with a selector.  
   The pull subscriber will receive each write made on any path matching the selector,
   and will pull on demand and print the received path/value.

   Typical usage:
   ```bash
      zn_pull
   ```
   or
   ```bash
      zn_pull -s /demo/**
   ```

### zn_query

   Sends a query message for a selector.  
   The queryables with a matching path or selector (for instance [zn_eval](#zn_eval) and [zn_storage](#zn_storage))
   will receive this query and reply with paths/values that will be received by the query callback.

   Typical usage:
   ```bash
      zn_query
   ```
   or
   ```bash
      zn_query -s /demo/**
   ```

### zn_eval

   Registers a queryable function with a path.  
   This queryable function will be triggered by each call to a query operation on janu-net
   with a selector that matches the path, and will return a value to the querier.

   Typical usage:
   ```bash
      zn_eval
   ```
   or
   ```bash
      zn_eval -p /demo/example/eval -v 'This is the result'
   ```

### zn_storage

   Trivial implementation of a storage in memory.  
   This examples registers a subscriber and a queryable on the same selector.
   The subscriber callback will store the received paths/values in an hashmap.
   The queryable callback will answer to queries with the paths/values stored in the hashmap
   and that match the queried selector.

   Typical usage:
   ```bash
      zn_storage
   ```
   or
   ```bash
      zn_storage -s /demo/**
   ```

### zn_pub_shm & zn_sub_shm

   A pub/sub example involving the zero-copy feature based on shared memory.

   Typical Subscriber usage:
   ```bash
      zn_sub_shm
   ```

   Typical Publisher usage:
   ```bash
      j_pub_shm
   ```

### zn_pub_thr & zn_sub_thr

   Pub/Sub throughput test.
   This example allows to perform throughput measurements between a pubisher performing
   write operations and a subscriber receiving notifications of those writes.

   Typical Subscriber usage:
   ```bash
      zn_sub_thr
   ```

   Typical Publisher usage:
   ```bash
      zn_pub_thr 1024
   ```

### zn_ping & zn_pong

   Pub/Sub roundtrip time test.
   This example allows to perform roundtrip time measurements. The zn_ping example 
   performs a write operation on a first resource, waits for a reply from the pong 
   example on a second resource and measures the time between the two.
   The pong application waits for samples on the first resource and replies by
   writing back the received data on the second resource.

   Typical Pong usage:
   ```bash
      zn_pong
   ```

   Typical Ping usage:
   ```bash
      zn_ping 1024
   ```

### zn_pub_shm_thr & zn_sub_shm_thr

   Pub/Sub throughput test involving the zero-copy feature based on shared memory.
   This example allows to perform throughput measurements between a pubisher performing
   write operations with the zero-copy feature and a subscriber receiving notifications
   of those writes.

   Typical Subscriber usage:
   ```bash
      zn_sub_shm_thr
   ```

   Typical Publisher usage:
   ```bash
      zn_pub_shm_thr
   ```
