The *janu-rust* library provides a Rust client API for *janu*.

An introduction to *janu* and its concepts is available on `janu.io <https://janu.io>`_.

Note that this library also provides a low-level API *janu-net*
that gives access to the janu protocol primitives and allow some
advanced use cases where a fine tuning of the protocol is required.
